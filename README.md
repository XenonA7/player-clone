# player-clone
Adds a Lv.1 neutral melee custom skill to Lea for creating a player clone. If Xenon's Playable Classes is installed, the characters from that mod can also equip this skill.
This is just for fun, the game was clearly not designed for this and some jank is expected.

Code created by Eisus (https://github.com/2hh8899). Custom skill entry implemented by XenonA7.
